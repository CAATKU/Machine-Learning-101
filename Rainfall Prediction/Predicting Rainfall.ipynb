    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial takes a practical and coding-focused approach. We'll learn how to apply _logistic regression_ to a real-world dataset from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/datasets):\n",
    "\n",
    "> **QUESTION**: The [Rain in Australia dataset](https://kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package) contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations. Here's a small sample from the dataset:\n",

    "> As a data scientist at the Bureau of Meteorology, you are tasked with creating a fully-automated system that can use today's weather data for a given location to predict whether it will rain at the location tomorrow. \n",

    "In this tutorial, we'll train a _logistic regression_ model using the Rain in Australia dataset to predict whether or not it will rain at a location tomorrow, using today's data. This is a _binary classification_ problem.\n",

    "Let's install the `scikit-learn` library which we'll use to train our model."
