# Machine Learning Projects

Hey Gits, Machine Learning is on fire right now. It's everyone. From the mobile phone you hold to the mind blowing self-driving cars. So, I started experimenting & started exploring the vast domain of Machine Learning and I think coding projects is the only way to learn effectively, atleast for me. And then learning in public is just so much better and 100x more effective! I want everyone out there to participate here!

I also have another repository dedicated to Data Analysis, which can be found [here](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Data-Science-Projects---EDA). In that repo, I focus on **Data Analysis** only and did not mention anything much about **Machine Learning**, but this repo is all about it! Not to forget, I'll still
be doing **Explortory Data Analysis** on a dataset before applying Machine Learning algorithms. 

I have great projects on my mind, and the first project I'm going to start with is a **Heart Disease Classification** problem. A fairly simple one, but a very good start. I'll also move towards towards **Deep Learning** projects, gradually ofcourse as I'm still learning, fortunately we all are, so have a look below!

## Learning & Contribution
Well, this is the fun part and the main point of this repository is to learn. I believe practice **will** make me a much better Machine Learning engineer, and hopefully you will too. So...

I've made this repo open to contributions! If there's a Machine Learning project you want to here, you can feel free to create an issue with your project details, I'd love to tackle it! And ofcourse if anyone else wants to tackle it - he can, I'll be ever so grateful!
