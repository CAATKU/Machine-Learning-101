# Machine Learning Projects


> **Note** **[Hop on Board my Machine Learning Journey OF 365 Days Of Machine Learning](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Machine-Learning-101/blob/main/twitter.md)**

Hey ML maniacs! Welcome Home - a place where you can learn about ML and tell the whole world about what you know! This repository is based on the idea of helping
poeple gain more knowledge in ML by making projects, some excerises and cheatsheets (Excerises & CheatSheets comming soon) - so why not! C'mon and help others with your skills!

## Learning AND Contribution
Well, this is the fun part, and as previously mentioned the main point of this repository is to learn and teach. I believe practice **will** make me a much and many others become a better at Machine Learning. So...

I've made this repo open to contributions! If there's a Machine Learning project you want here, you can feel free to create an issue with your project details, I'd love to tackle it! And of course if anyone else wants to do it - you surely can, I'll be ever so grateful!

Just go through the [Contributing.md](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Machine-Learning-101/blob/main/Contributing.md) to get familiar with the process. Trust me, it's not long!

## Current Progress
* Working on Dog Vision (Classifiying Dog Breeds)
* Also working on some cheatsheets I'm looking forward to adding here - Topics (Python CheatSheet); This will take some time...hopefully by end of month.
