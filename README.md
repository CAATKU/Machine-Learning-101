# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Projects

Hey Machine Learning Maniacs ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to the club of Machine Learning - a place where you can learn about ML and tell the whole world about what you know! This repository reveloves arond the idea of helping poeple to break into the hot domain of Artificial Intelligence.

This repo covers a range of topics (Atleast it will.....I'm working on it!), starting from basics classification projects to Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. This repository also has a page for the recources that you could use to learn about some specific topics. Soon, I'll have some cheatsheets on topics like Python, Numpy, Scikit Learn etc. to help you even more!

## ðŸ”— Some Things...
1. [Project Table of Contents](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Machine-Learning-101/blob/main/Project%20Table%20of%20Contents.md) (IMPORTANT)
2. [Machine Learning Recourses](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Machine-Learning-101/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Recourses.md)
3. [Hop on Board my Machine Learning Journey OF 365 Days Of Machine Learning](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Machine-Learning-101/blob/main/twitter.md)

## ðŸš§ Current Progress
* Working on Dog Vision (Classifiying Dog Breeds)
* Also working on some cheatsheets I'm looking forward to adding here - Topics (Python CheatSheet); This will take some time...hopefully by end of month.

## ðŸ“– Learning AND Contribution
Well, here's the main point of this repo - LEARNING! Contributing by reading & writing code is THE best way of getting good at anything, especially at such a deep domain as Machine Learning! So...start contributing TODAY!

If you can't code something, then go to this [page](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Machine-Learning-101/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Recourses.md) and share some AI releated recourse you think should be an amazing addition! Contributions OPEN FOR EVERYONE, I mean **EVERYONE**!

Just go through the [Contributing.md](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Machine-Learning-101/blob/main/Contributing.md) to get familiar with the process. Trust me, it's not long!
