# Machine Learning Projects


> **Note** **[Hop on Board my Machine Learning Journey OF 365 Days Of Machine Learning](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Machine-Learning-101/blob/main/twitter.md)**

Hey ML maniacs! Welcome Home - a place where you can learn about ML and tell the whole world about what you know! This repository is based on the idea of helping
poeple gain more knowledge in ML by making projects, some excerises and cheatsheets (Excerises & CheatSheets comming soon) - so why not! C'mon and help others with your skills!

## Some Things...
1. [Project Table of Contents](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Machine-Learning-101/blob/main/Project%20Table%20of%20Contents.md) (IMPORTANT)
2. [Machine Learning Recourses](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Machine-Learning-101/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Recourses.md)

## Current Progress
* Working on Dog Vision (Classifiying Dog Breeds)
* Also working on some cheatsheets I'm looking forward to adding here - Topics (Python CheatSheet); This will take some time...hopefully by end of month.

## Learning AND Contribution
Well, here's the main point of this repo - LEARNING! Contributing by reading & writing code is THE best way of getting good at anything, especially at such a deep domain as Machine Learning! So...start contributing TODAY!

Just go through the [Contributing.md](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Machine-Learning-101/blob/main/Contributing.md) to get familiar with the process. Trust me, it's not long!
