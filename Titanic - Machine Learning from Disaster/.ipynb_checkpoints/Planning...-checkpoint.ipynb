    "This dataset is from Kaggle, under their begginer **Machine Learning** Projects section. And yes indeed, this is a very starightforward and an easy to project to walkthrough, yet giving you a good grasp on the basics of Machine Learning as well as Data Science. However mainly **Machine Learning**.\n",
